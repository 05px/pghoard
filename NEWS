pghoard X.X.X (2016-XX-XX)
==========================

* Support for Telegraf statsd
* New `basebackup_mode` option: `local-tar` to collect files directly from
  `$PGDATA` instead of running pg_basebackup.  The `local-tar` mode allows
  backing up user tablespaces
* Basebackup handling was refactored to more cleanly handle the different
  operation modes: pipe data directly from pg_basebackup's stdout to PGHoard
  compression or collect the temporary tar files first that pg_basebackup
  writes itself.  This introduced a new configuration option per site:
  `basebackup_mode` which supersedes the old `stream_compression` config
  option
* Revamped file transformation (encryption, compression) interfaces
* Make sure object storage modules are importable when reading configuration
  instead of only checking it when they are used

pghoard 1.3.0 (2016-05-30)
==========================

* Support for PostgreSQL 9.6 (beta 1)
* Always use strings as metadata keys and values in object storage, fixing
  recent issues with Google Cloud Storage which started throwing a "Backend
  Error" when an integer value was used as well as fixing old WAL cleanup.
* Make LZMA compression level configurable
* Fix unprocessed file handling in receivexlog mode after restart
* Miscellaneous bug fixes

pghoard 1.2.0 (2016-04-28)
==========================

* Support for PostgreSQL 9.2
* Support for Python 3.3
* Various commands no longer require site if a config file with a single
  site is used.  Configuration handling was refactored and much improved
* S3 multipart uploads for greater network error resiliency
* Creating new basebackups by timer can be disabled entirely for a site by
  removing the basebackup_interval_hours option or setting it to a null
  value
* Ignore requests to archive backup labels, they are not used by PGHoard
* Emit a warning when running under systemd without python-systemd installed
* Test and logging improvements, including support for proper use of syslog
* Miscellaneous bug fixes

pghoard 1.1.0 (2016-04-05)
==========================

* Consider last basebackup's start time instead of completion time for
  scheduling the next basebackup
* pghoard_create_keys can now update an existing configuration file
* Support for OpenStack Swift object storage
* More generic object storage configuration.  All configuration keys for
  object stores are passed as-is to the implementation.  This also meant
  that some defaults were dropped: bucket_name and container_name must be
  manually set, they no longer default to `pghoard`.
* New test cases to validate object storage interfaces - the tests revealed
  a couple of minor issues which have been fixed in this release
* ``pghoard`` can now be built from a checkout of a tag, namely generation
  version.py no longer requires a .git directory
* Documentation and build process improvements

pghoard 1.0.0 (2016-03-16)
==========================

* Support for PostgreSQL 9.3 - 9.5
* Support compressing basebackups on the fly
* Add archive_sync command to sync archive / check archive integrity
* Support different recovery_targets
* Support encryption and integrity protection of the backup files
* Snappy compression support
* Better unittests (also with an actual PostgreSQL)
* Require Python3.4 or newer
* Support prefetching files during restore
* Bug fixes

pghoard 0.9.0 (2015-06-19)
============================

* Initial release
