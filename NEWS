pghoard 1.1.0 (2016-04-05)
==========================

* Consider last basebackup's start time instead of completion time for
  scheduling the next basebackup
* pghoard_create_keys can now update an existing configuration file
* Support for OpenStack Swift object storage
* More generic object storage configuration.  All configuration keys for
  object stores are passed as-is to the implementation.  This also meant
  that some defaults were dropped: bucket_name and container_name must be
  manually set, they no longer default to `pghoard`.
* New test cases to validate object storage interfaces - the tests revealed
  a couple of minor issues which have been fixed in this release
* ``pghoard`` can now be built from a checkout of a tag, namely generation
  version.py no longer requires a .git directory
