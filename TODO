TODO
====

* configurable recovery target recovery.conf (to be created by restore)
* SSL support for Webserver
* Authentication/authorization for Webserver for use in non private networks
* check that we have the diskspace needed for a basebackup from PG
* Older PG version support (WAL segment number holes, something else?)
